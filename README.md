- Collapse or expand all groups at once
- Access advanced settings:

### Color Management

The extension provides several ways to manage tab group colors:

1. **Automatic Colors**: Each domain gets a consistent color by default
2. **Manual Customization**:
   - Right-click any tab group to change its color
   - The extension can remember your custom color choices
3. **Random Generation**:
   - Click "Generate New Colors" to randomly assign new colors
   - Use the "Preserve manual colors" setting to keep your custom choices when generating new colors

### Group Management

## üß† How It Works

### Tab Grouping Logic

- Uses the [`browser.tabs.group()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/group) API
- Groups tabs based on their root domain
- Maintains group consistency during tab operations (refresh, new tab, etc.)
- Intelligently formats domain names for group titles:
  - Removes TLD (e.g., ".com", ".org")
  - Removes "www" subdomain when present
  - Special handling for IP addresses and local domains

### Color Management

- Uses Firefox's built-in tab group colors: blue, cyan, grey, green, orange, pink, purple, red, yellow
- Tracks user-customized colors separately from automatically assigned ones
- Provides options to preserve or regenerate colors as needed
- Persists color preferences across browser sessions

### Group State Management

- Tracks collapse state of all groups
- Provides unified controls for group visibility
- Maintains group state during tab operations
- Ensures smooth transitions when collapsing/expanding
