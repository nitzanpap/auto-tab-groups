# Firefox Manifest V3 Upgrade ✅

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Firefox was showing errors because it was using Manifest V2 while the codebase was written for Manifest V3 service workers. This created compatibility issues with ES modules and modern browser APIs.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

**Upgraded Firefox to Manifest V3** - Much simpler than downgrading Chrome to V2!

### Before (❌ Mixed Architecture)

```json
// Chrome: Manifest V3
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js",
    "type": "module"
  }
}

// Firefox: Manifest V2  
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }
}
```

### After (✅ Unified Architecture with Firefox-specific syntax)

```json
// Chrome: Manifest V3
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js",
    "type": "module"
  }
}

// Firefox: Manifest V3 (Firefox syntax)
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "type": "module"
  }
}
```

## 🎉 Benefits

### ✅ Code Simplification

- **Single architecture** for both browsers
- **No more ES module incompatibility** issues
- **Same service worker model** across platforms

### ✅ Firefox Compatibility

- **Firefox 109+** supports Manifest V3 (January 2023)
- **Modern API support** with proper ES modules
- **Better error handling** and debugging

### ✅ Future-Proof

- **Both browsers moving to V3** as the standard
- **Unified development experience**
- **Easier maintenance** going forward

## 🔍 Key Differences Handled

| Feature | Chrome | Firefox | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Manifest | V3 | V3 | ✅ Unified |
| Service Worker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Unified |
| ES Modules | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Fixed |
| Tab Groups API | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Graceful degradation |
| Side Panel | `side_panel` | `sidebar_action` | ✅ Browser-specific keys |

## 🧪 Testing

Run Firefox development mode to test:

```bash
npm run dev:firefox
```

The extension should now load without the TypeError issues you were seeing!

## 📊 Result

Firefox extension now uses the same modern architecture as Chrome, eliminating compatibility issues and providing a much cleaner development experience. 🚀
