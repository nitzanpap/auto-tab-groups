# Privacy Policy for Auto Tab Groups

Auto Tab Groups does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data and operations remain local to the user's browser. We do not use tracking scripts, analytics, or third-party cookies.

This extension only uses the minimum permissions required to function, such as accessing tab URLs to group them by domain.
