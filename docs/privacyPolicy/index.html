    <h1>Privacy Policy for Auto Tab Groups</h1>

    <p>
      Auto Tab Groups does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All
      operations performed by the extension occur entirely within your browser and do not involve
      any external servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> use any tracking scripts, analytics, cookies, or external logging
      mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The extension uses browser permissions (such as <code>tabs</code> and <code>storage</code>)
      strictly to enable its functionality—namely, organizing open tabs into groups by domain. These
      permissions are used <strong>locally</strong> and <strong>only</strong> for improving user
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to maintaining user privacy and ensuring that no unnecessary permissions or
      third-party integrations are included.
