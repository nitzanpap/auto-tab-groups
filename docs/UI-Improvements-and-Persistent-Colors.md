# UI Improvements and Persistent Color Mapping

## Overview

This document summarizes the UI improvements and persistent color mapping feature implementation for the Auto Tab Groups extension.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Collapse/Expand UX

**Before**: Toggle switch with text that changes based on state
**After**: Two separate stateless buttons - "Collapse All" and "Expand All"

**Technical Details**:

- Replaced the single toggle with two separate buttons in `popup.html` and `sidebar.html`
- Updated `popup.js` to handle two separate click events
- Added new service methods: `collapseAllGroups()` and `expandAllGroups()`
- Added new background message handlers: `collapseAll` and `expandAll`
- Buttons are completely stateless - no need to track or update button state
- Better predictability: users always know what each button will do

### 2. Persistent Color Mapping

**Feature**: Save group colors persistently so they are retained after browser restarts

**Technical Implementation**:

#### Storage Layer (`StorageManager.js`)

- Added `groupColorMapping` to `DEFAULT_STATE`
- Added methods:
  - `getGroupColorMapping()` - Get all saved group colors
  - `saveGroupColorMapping(colorMapping)` - Save color mappings
  - `updateGroupColor(groupTitle, color)` - Update a single group's color
  - `getGroupColor(groupTitle)` - Get saved color for a specific group

#### Service Layer (`TabGroupService.js`)

- **Group Creation**: When creating new groups, check for saved colors and apply them
- **Generate New Colors**: Save new random colors to persistent storage
- **Color Restoration**: New `restoreSavedColors()` method to restore colors on startup
- **Background Integration**: Automatically restore colors when extension starts

#### Background Script (`background.js`)

- Added color restoration to startup initialization
- Added `restoreSavedColors` message handler for manual restoration

## User Experience Improvements

### Collapse/Expand Buttons

- **Stateless Design**: Two separate buttons that always perform their labeled action
- **No State Confusion**: "Collapse All" always collapses, "Expand All" always expands
- **Predictable Behavior**: Users never have to guess what the button will do
- **Firefox Compatible**: Collapse respects the active tab constraint automatically
- **Consistent**: Matches the visual style of other action buttons

### Persistent Colors

- **Reliability**: Colors are preserved across browser restarts
- **Consistency**: Groups maintain their assigned colors even when tabs are moved
- **Automatic**: Works seamlessly without user intervention
- **Custom Rules**: Custom rule colors are still prioritized and saved persistently

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Two separate stateless buttons eliminate confusion and provide predictable behavior
2. **Color Persistence**: Users don't lose their color assignments after restart
3. **Seamless Integration**: New features work with existing functionality
4. **Cross-Browser**: Compatible with both Chrome and Firefox
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing installations will work without issues

## Files Modified

- `extension/src/public/popup.html` - Updated UI structure
